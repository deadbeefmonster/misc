# Misc. scripts and files, perhaps useful to no one but me.


* ips_to_cidr.py: a little script to convert an IPs file (one IP per line, first arg) to CIDRs and then print out the CIDRs as a comma-delimited CSV with x number of CIDRs per row (second arg). `python3 ips_to_csv.py ips.txt 4 > ips.csv`
